          Japanese culture is a set of values that puts importance on social
          harmony and hard work. Up until the 10th century, Japanese culture was
          similar to the Chinese culture, but the rise of the samurai in the
          Heian Period and the isolation during the Edo Period changed the rules
          of society. Overall, the culture was influenced by the local Shinto
          religion, Buddhism, Confucianism and the limited natural resources.

          in Tokyo The life expectancy of Japanese people is 81.05 years for
          males and 87.09 years for female (2023). It is the longest in the
          world. 
          <h3>About living </h3>
          Scenery of central Tokyo and Mt.Fuji Scenery of
          central Tokyo and Mt.Fuji In Japan, there are three big city areas.
          They are Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya areas. The population of Tokyo area
          is about 34 million, Osaka area is about 18 million, and Nagoya area
          is about 11 million. The total population of these areas is about half
          of whole Japan. 
          <h3>About working</h3>

          Shinbashi station in Tokyo Workers returning to the home at Shinbashi
          station in Tokyo It's said that Japanese people is diligent. It is
          true that many of them work overtime and work on their day off. Of
          course, one reason is that their works are too much to be completed.
          But, overwork-deaths ("karoshi") and suicides by overwork are
          sometimes reported. This is a problem of the employer. 
          <h3>About eating</h3>

          bowl dish of rice topped with any cooked food Because working is most
          important for Japanese people, many hours of the day are spent for
          working. Japanese people usually have a meal three times a day, but
          the time for each meal is short because of busyness. In the morning,
          most people spend only a little time for breakfast, because they must
          go to far workplace.
